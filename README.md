# Static Page Generator

This project is a **Static Page Generator** developed as part of the Boot.dev Back-End Developer Career Path. It converts `.md` files from the `contents` folder into complete HTML pages, using a predefined HTML template and outputs them to the `public` folder.

## Description

The Static Page Generator automates the process of converting Markdown files into HTML. The generator reads Markdown files from the `contents` folder, applies the `template.html` for layout and styling, and saves the generated HTML files in the `public` folder. You can run the program using `main.py` in the `src` folder or via `main.sh` in the root folder for convenience.

## Usage

1. Place Markdown (`.md`) files in the `contents` folder. Each file here will be processed and converted into an HTML file in the `public` folder.

2. Ensure `template.html` is available in the root folder. This file serves as the main layout and structure template for each generated HTML page.

3. Images can be placed in the `static/images` folder, and the `static` folder also contains the CSS file for styling.

4. Run the generator:

   - From the `src` folder:
     ```bash
     python src/main.py
     ```
   - From the root folder:
     ```bash
     ./main.sh
     ```
